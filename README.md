The exercise was done in python3. 

## Run the server
With Python 3 installed, run `current_weather.py` and a new webserver should bind to `localhost:8080`.
In order to request a specific file, just add the file's name to the path (i.e. `localhost:8080/ZUCK.TXT`).

## Run the tests
With Python 3 installed, run `current_weather_tests.py` and the test suite will run. All tests should pass.
